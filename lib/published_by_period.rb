require 'published_by_period/railtie' if defined?(Rails)

# Allows a given boolean, date, or datetime column to indicate whether a model object is published.
# Boolean published column just is an on/off flag.
# Date/datetime column requires value of published column to be before "now" for the object to be published.
# Specify the column name via the :on option (defaults to :published) and make sure to create the column
# in your migrations.
#
# Provides scopes for finding published and unpublished items, and (for date/datetime published columns) for returning
# recent or upcoming items.

    # @!method published
    #   Query scope added to publishables that can be used to find published records. For Date/DateTime publishables,
    #   you can pass a specific date on which the results should be published.
    #   @example Find only records that are currently published
    #     published_posts = Post.published
    #   @example Find only records that will be published in two days
    #     future_posts = Post.published(Date.current + 2.days)
    #   @param [Date, Time, nil] when Specify a date/time for Date/DateTime publishables - defaults to the current date/time
    #   @!scope class

    # @!method unpublished
    #   Query scope added to publishables that can be used find records which are not published. For Date/DateTime
    #   publishables, you can pass a specific date on which the results should not have been published.
    #   @example Find only records that are not currently published
    #     unpublished_posts = Post.unpublished
    #   @param [Date, Time, nil] when Specify a date/time for Date/DateTime publishables - defaults to the current date/time
    #   @!scope class

    # @!method recent
    #   Query scope added to publishables that can be used to lookup records which are currently published. The results
    #   are returned in descending order based on the published date/time.
    #   @example Get the 10 most recently-published records
    #     recent_posts = Post.recent(10)
    #   @param [Integer, nil] how_many Specify how many records to return
    #   @!scope class

    # @!method upcoming
    #   Query scope added to publishables that can be used to lookup records which are not currently published. The
    #   results are returned in ascending order based on the published date/time.
    #   @example Get all posts that will be published in the future
    #     upcoming_posts = Post.upcoming
